# 4_DOF_Manipulator
This is a repository for the project named 4 DOF Axis Mechanical grab Manipulator. This project is a part of Mechanical Design Methods course, Robotics Engineering, during my master's at the University of Genova, Italy.


## Software requirements

* Creo Parametric 5.0.4.0

## Design and References
The 4 degree Of Freedom Axis Mechanical grab Manipulator is designed using **Creo software** with the reference of [TA0262 ARDUINO ROBOT ARM 4DOF MECHANICAL CLAW KIT](https://github.com/chetanchandc/4_DOF_Manipulator/blob/main/Instruction%20Manual.pdf) and  [Drawing an Approximate Representation of an Involute
Spur Gear Tooth](https://github.com/chetanchandc/4_DOF_Manipulator/blob/main/Approx_method_draw_involute_tooth_rev2.pdf)


# Contents of the repository
In this section, we will explain the repository's content


## Design_Views
The representation of the **default orientation** is given below:

</p>

Whereas, Right_View, Left_View, Front_View, Back_View, Top_View, Bottom_View ´s are availble here [Design_Views](https://github.com/chetanchandc/4_DOF_Manipulator/tree/main/Design_Views)

## Measures_Graphs
This folder contains all the possible **graphical represenations** which compares Kinematic(Default), Dynamic(Force), Dynamic(Gravity), and Dynamic(Gravity+Force) with respect to angles and positions repsectively.

The representation of the Dynamic(Gravity+Force) with respect to angles and positions is given below:

</p>

Whereas, the remaining possible graphical represenations are availble here [Measures_Graphs](https://github.com/chetanchandc/4_DOF_Manipulator/tree/main/Measures_Graphs)


## Parts_Assmeble
This **main folder** [Parts_Assmeble](https://github.com/chetanchandc/4_DOF_Manipulator/tree/main/Parts_Assmeble) contains all the parts and assmeblies of the manipulator which are designed using Creo Software. These are saved as an extension of .prt and .asm respectively.

## Simulation_Videos
This folder contains the video tutorials on how the analysis of the four possiblities work. The four simulation videos are divided into following:
