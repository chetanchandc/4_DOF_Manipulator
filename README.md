# 4_DOF_Manipulator
This is a repository for the project named 4 DOF Axis Mechanical grab Manipulator. This project is a part of Mechanical Design Methods course, Robotics Engineering, during my master's at the University of Genova, Italy.


## Design and References
The 4 degree Of Freedom Axis Mechanical grab Manipulator is designed using **Creo software** with the reference of [TA0262 ARDUINO ROBOT ARM 4DOF MECHANICAL CLAW KIT](https://github.com/chetanchandc/4_DOF_Manipulator/blob/main/Instruction%20Manual.pdf) and  [spur](https://github.com/chetanchandc/4_DOF_Manipulator/blob/main/Approx_method_draw_involute_tooth_rev2.pdf)

## Software requirements

* Creo Parametric 5.0.4.0


# Contents of the repository
In this section, we will explain the repository's content

## Parts_Assmeble
This folder contains all the parts and assmeblies of the manipulator, which are saved as an extension of .prt and .asm respectively.

## Simulation_Video
The four simulation videos are divided into following:
